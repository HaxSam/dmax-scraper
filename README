Hey guys u wanna scrape some videos from dmax?
I coded this for a friend of mine, and I think it's pretty cool.

I wrote this in Typescript and used Deno and youtube-dl to scrape the videos.
U wanna use it? No problem!

Here is how to use it:
First u need deno and youtube-dl.

To install deno:
go to the deno website and follow the instructions. https://deno.land/

To install youtube-dl:
go to the youtube-dl website and follow the instructions. https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/

So how to use the dmax scraper:
INFO: Deno need access to your drive, network and running commands. Thats why u have to give him the premissions to do that.

First method:
1. Open the terminal and type: deno run --allow-net --allow-run --allow-write="." --allow-read="." mod.ts <url>
2. And u using the scraper :)

Secound method:
1. Open the terminal and type: deno compile --allow-net --allow-run --allow-write="." --allow-read="." mod.ts
2. Now u can use the executable file and but it in every folder where u would like to use it.
3. Run the executable: ./dmax-scraper <url>

Third method:
1. Open the terminal and type: deno install --allow-net --allow-run --allow-write --allow-read -n dmax-scraper https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaxSam/dmax-scraper/main/mod.ts
2. Now u installed the scraper globaly and u can use the scraper in every folder where u would like to use it.
3. Go to the folder where u wanna store the series
4. Run the scraper: dmax-scraper <url>
